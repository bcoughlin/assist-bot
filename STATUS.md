# Discord Bot - Current Status & Management

## ✅ Bot is Currently ONLINE

- **Bot Name**: LastZAiBeta#4976
- **Status**: Connected to Discord
- **Model**: LastzAiBeta (Your custom Poe model)
- **Process ID**: 57851

## How the Deployment Actually Works

### The Confusing Truth
The current setup requires **two steps** because of how Modal apps work:

1. **`./deploy.sh`** - Only deploys the *functions* to Modal (doesn't start the bot)
2. **`modal run main.py::main`** - Actually *starts* the Discord bot

### Why This Happens
- Modal deployment creates the functions but doesn't call `main()`
- The `main()` function is what actually starts the Discord connection
- We run it in background with `nohup ... &` to keep it running

## Easy Management

Use the new management script:

```bash
# Check if bot is running
./bot.sh status

# Start the bot (deploy + start)
./bot.sh start

# Stop the bot
./bot.sh stop

# Restart the bot
./bot.sh restart

# Watch live logs
./bot.sh logs
```

## Files Created

- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Detailed deployment explanation
- **`bot.sh`** - Easy management script
- **`bot.log`** - Bot runtime logs

## The Bottom Line

Your bot is working! The deployment process is just more complex than it should be. The bot is:
- ✅ Online in Discord as "LastZAiBeta#4976"
- ✅ Using your custom LastzAiBeta model from Poe
- ✅ Ready to respond to mentions
